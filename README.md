## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a lover of code and developing logic, my passion is problem-solving. I would say I'm very curious because I always seeking new challenges to get better at myself.

Currently, I'm a FullStack developer at Bairesdev working with Pinterest in the Advertiser Automation Team, I like to be involved in building software from scratch, optimizing applications, looking for bugs and fixing them, creating flowcharts, working to achieve great things together, looking for the best way to do the job and most of all "coding" ðŸ¤—.
